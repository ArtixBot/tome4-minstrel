# tome4-minstrel
The Minstrel class is a dagger-wielding musician capable of utilizing song with devastating effect.

This addon implements the following:

- 20 new abilities across 5 different trees: Musical Combat, Battle Ballads, Wit, Card Invocation, and Performance Arts.
  - **Musical Combat** (DEX): Combat dual-wielding techniques with a focus on global speed manipulation.
  - **Battle Ballads** (WIL): A twist on Chants; gain three sustainable but incompatible ballads, and skills which gain new effects based on your currently active Ballad.
  - **Wit** (CUN): A combo-oriented tree. Abilities exploit a new debuff (Mental Instability) to gain additional effects.
  - **Card Invocation** (CUN): Place your faith in eighteen different cards split into three decks: Benevolence, Malevolence, and Oddities. If you're lucky, you may draw Aces, which trigger incredibly (over)powered effects.
  - **Performance Arts** (CUN): Provides a mix of offensive, defensive, and utility abilities to enhance combat prowess.
- A new artifact set, consisting of 2 artifacts.
  - **Victario's Trick Lute**: High-damage dagger that dazes on crit and boosts mastery of new ability trees.
  - **Victario's Tasting Chalice**: Provides bonus blight and nature damage, and damages attacking enemies.
- Multiple Darkest Dungeon and Jojo references

All new ability and effect icons were created using www.game-icons.net.
