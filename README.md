# tome4-minstrel
Adds a new class, twenty new abilities, and two new artifacts to the roguelike ToME4.
Also includes (many) Darkest Dungeon references and (at least 1) Jojo's reference.
The Minstrel class is a dagger-wielding musician capable of utilizing music to its greatest effect.

Thanks to:

ToME4's IRC channel for immeasurable amounts of help in debugging.
Andrew Plumb for lute image (used in Victario's Trick Lute).
Nicolas "DarkGod" Casalini for creating the game!
